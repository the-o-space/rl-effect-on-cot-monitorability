The best practice is to design the monorepo so each RL experiment module is a self-contained Python package with its own config, entrypoint, and Dockerfile. This enables running and testing locally (using mock models/datasets), as well as one-command packaging/deployment of just that module to RunPod, not the entire repo. Here’s how to set this up:

### Directory and packaging structure

```
/monorepo-root
  /rl_experiments/
    /exp1/
      __init__.py
      train.py                # Main entrypoint for RL training
      config.yaml             # Default config for this experiment
      Dockerfile              # Minimal image for just this module
      requirements.txt        # Experiment-specific deps
      test_train.py           # Fast unit test for local mock
    /exp2/
      ...
  /shared/
    # Optionally, shared utilities (put as proper package)
  pyproject.toml              # for shared tools/utilities
```

### How to package and deploy a single experiment

- **Experiment entrypoint:** Each `train.py` should parse config, start training, and fall back to mock models if a certain flag or ENV is set.
- **Dockerfile:** Each experiment folder can have its own Dockerfile:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.10-slim
  WORKDIR /workspace
  COPY requirements.txt .
  RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
  COPY . .
  ENTRYPOINT ["python", "train.py"]
  ```

- **One-command local test:**  
  Run locally with:
  ```sh
  python train.py --config config.yaml --mock
  ```
  The code should switch to a LightRLModel or dummy dataset in mock mode for fast iterations.
  
- **One-command RunPod build/deploy:**  
  From inside the experiment directory:
  ```sh
  docker build -t youruser/exp1:latest .
  docker push youruser/exp1:latest
  ```
  Then launch a RunPod Pod with this image using either the UI or the API, with `config.yaml` included in the Docker context.

- **Real RL runs:**  
  The Docker build only includes `exp1/`, so dependencies and environment are isolated and lean—rebuilding and deploying does not touch other experiments.  
  Use RunPod’s "Custom Image" Pod feature to launch just this module with its own storage and environment variables.

### Local testability

- Use a fast, mockable RL environment/model activated by a config flag or environment variable (`--mock` or `USE_MOCK_MODEL=1`).
- Each `test_train.py` (pytest file) should validate that the experiment runs and logs basics in under 1 minute, without heavy downloads.
- This makes debugging, profiling, and CI much faster—no need to wait for cloud deployment to catch simple errors.

### CI and reproducibility

- Add a GitHub Actions workflow, Pants, or Makefile that lets you build, test, and package each experiment independently.
- Example workflow:
  - `python -m pytest test_train.py`
  - `docker build`/`docker push`
- Track configs, requirements hashes, and Git commit for every run.

### Notes

- For large shared datasets or model weights, bind-mount at runtime or use RunPod network volumes.
- You can expose a CLI param or env to switch between "mock mode" and real RL training mode in `train.py`.
- The rest of your logic (eval, serving) can be similarly modularized, each as a package with its own entrypoint and Dockerfile.

This setup lets you launch just a single RL experiment module onto RunPod or run/debug it locally with nothing but Python and Docker—making iteration, testing, and scaling much faster, and avoiding the overhead of packaging your entire research codebase for every job.[1][2][3][4]
